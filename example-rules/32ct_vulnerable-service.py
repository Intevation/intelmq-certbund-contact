"""Sample Rules to generate directives from Events
which are classified as 'vulnerable'


This script is supposed to handle events from:
 - Shadowserver Open* Feeds
 - Owncloud and Nextcloud data

Assumptions:
 - Events which are part of the "vulnerable service" type
   carry different classification.identifiers, thus the different
   types of vulnerabilities can be distinguished.
