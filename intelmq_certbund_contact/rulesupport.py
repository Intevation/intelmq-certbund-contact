class Directive:

    """Notification directive

    A notification directive indicates to other components, e.g.
    intelmq-mailgen, which notifications should be sent where based on
    the event the directive is associated with.

    Attributes:
        medium (str): The transport medium for the notification.
            So far, only "email" is implemented. More will likely come, such
            as "xmpp"
        recipient_address (str): medium-specific address.
            For email, the email address, obviously.
        aggregate_fields (set of str): Set of event field names that are
            to be part of the aggregate identifier. See aggregation,
            below.
        aggregate_key (dict): Key/value pairs to be part of the
            aggregate identifier. See aggregation, below.
        notification_interval (int): Interval between notifications for
            similar events. Two events are considered similar in this
            sense if they have equal aggregate identifiers.
        notification_format (str): The main format of the notification.
            Suggested values: ``"text"`` for human readable mail with
            e.g. event data inline or as attachment, ``"xarf"`` for
            mail in X-ARF format.
        event_data_format (str): The format to use for event data
            included in the notification. Its meaning depends on the
            notification format.
        template_name (str): The name of the template for the contents
            of the notification. Its meaning depends on the notification
            format. Mostly useful for human readable (parts of)
            notifications, e.g. text email or the human readable part of
            X-ARF mails.

    **Aggregation**

    Multiple notification directives may be aggregated into a single
    notification. Directives may only be aggregated when they are
    sufficiently similar. Not only do they have to be sent to the same
    recipient using the same medium and format, often they must also be
    similar enough in other respects, e.g. by being related to the same
    ASN.

    This similarity is defined with the aggregation identifier which is
    conceptually a set of key/value pairs (set in the sense that each
    key must occur only once). Directives with equal aggregation
    identifiers may be aggregated because they are considered to
    sufficiently similar. Some parts of it are implicit, such as a the
    parameters for the more physical aspects of the notification (e.g.
    medium, address, etc.). The other parts have to be handled
    explicitly. In this class this is done with the two attributes
    :py:attr:`aggregate_key` and :py:attr:`aggregate_fields`. The former
    is a dict whose contents are simply treated as part of the
    aggregation identifier. The latter is a set of event field names and
    these names together with the corresponding values from the event
    are also treated as part of the aggregation identifier. The
    aggregate_fields attribute is mainly meant for convenience so that
    one does not have to copy the actual attributes explicitly.


    **JSON-Representation**

    When converted to JSON, a directive is a JSON-Object whose keys and
    values are the public attributes of the Directive instance with the
    exception of :py:attr:`aggregate_fields` and
    :py:attr:`aggregate_key`, which are combined into a single
    dictionary in the obvious way and included in the JSON object under
    the key ``"aggregate_identifier"``.
